# CountriesUi

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.10.

## Running COUNTRY-UI

## Start dev server

```bash
npm start
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
